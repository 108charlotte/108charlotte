Hi! My name is Charlotte, and welcome to my GitHub profile! I have been coding since 6th grade and during middle school grew familiar with several programming languages and coded for my school's robotics team. However, I only really picked up programming as a hobby in January 2025, after taking CS50x and discovering that programming could be used as a tool to build cool projects or even for self-expression! Since then, I have worked on a large collection of largely unrelated projects, with the primary similarity between most of them being that they incorporate some form of Python, typically through Flask. If you have the time, I hope you can check out some of my projects! I am always open to feedback, so if you do and have any suggestions for improvements, please let me know!
